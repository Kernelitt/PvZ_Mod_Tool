The NEW PvZ1 Modding Info Doc
Instructions (PLEASE READ)
This is the current PvZ1 Modding Document meant for the Original Release of PvZ1. It is maintained and upheld by the new modding group, and it will share all sorts of code findings for people to use in their mods.

(A side note; your hex code is dependent on the program you use. Hxd Code starts at “0”, whereas Cheat engine code Starts at “400000” Respectively. So if you were using a CE Address, you would have to subtract 4 from the first (last?) digit from the number. So 400400 Would become 400, so on and so forth.)

Custom Window Name Tutorial 
(Note: You must have a code cave before doing this) Go to 44EC93 in Cheat Engine. This is your character limit. Change it, then go to 0044EC84 and change it to jmp (code cave). At that code cave, use the hex part in Cheat Engine to write your new title. Save it with either OllyDGB or HxD.

   1. Go to 00983A in HxD, change 117 in Int8 from Data Inspector to 112 
   2. Go to 00983E, change 73 in Int8 to
   * nothing (yes, don’t change anything) will make the spawn rate multiply by 6 (possibly spawn 6 units* of zombies at the beginning)
   * 8, will make the spawn rate multiply by 2 (possibly spawn 2 units of zombies at the beginning), but it’ll break 2nd round of Adventure’s spawn rate into massive
   * 10, will make the game spawn 2 units of zombies at the beginning, and add 4 units of zombies in every 3 waves, but it’ll ruin every huge wave spawns into massive
   * 9, will make the spawn rate multiply by 4 (possibly spawn 4 units of zombies at the beginning)
   * 16, will make the game not spawn zombies at the first 3 waves, then normally spawn with 2 multiplier (possibly spawn 2 units of zombies at the beginning), but it’ll ruin every huge wave spawns into massive, and also will break 2nd round of Adventure’s spawn rate into massive
   * 7, will make the spawn rate go extremely high
* Without changing any other codes, 1 unit = 1 basic; 2 units = 1 conehead / 2 basic; 3 units = 1 conehead + 1 basic / 3 basic; 4 units = 1 buckethead / 2 conehead / 1 conehead + 2 basic / 4 basic; 5 units = 1 buckethead + 1 basic / 2 conehead + 1 basic / 1 conehead + 3 basic / 5 basic; and so on
^ Note that this change will affect the entire game spawn rate schedule, including Column Like You See ‘Em, Wall-nut Bowling, Portal Combat, Big Trouble Little Zombie and more


spawn increase factor:
4096ca: last stand tier increase
40970a: survivals tier increase
409734: adventure replay tier increase
409748: all other levels tier increase        


formula is the value representing value between 0 and 1. the tier can be determined by (wavenum((value)/100000000))rounded down + 1, or in other words up 1 every 100000000/(value) waves, starting at 1. For example:
10000000: up 1 every 16 waves
11111112: up 1 every 15 waves
22222223: up 1 every 7.5 waves
33333334: up 1 every 5 waves
40000000: up 1 every 4 waves
55555556: up 1 every 3 waves (used for most levels)
66666667: up 1 every 2.5 waves (used for last stand, survivals, and adventure replays)
77777778: up 1 every 2.14285714... waves 
80000000: up 1 every 2 waves
9999999A for up 1 every 1.666666 waves
AAAAAAAB: up 1 every 1.5 waves
BBBBBBBC: up 1 every 1.363636 waves
CCCCCCCD: up 1 every 1.25 waves
DDDDDDDE: up 1 every 1.15384615 waves
EEEEEEEF: up 1 every 1.07142857 waves


note: anything over 77777778 requires changing command below from imul to mul or else it will break spawning (no zombies spawn except first 3 and flags)  


For up 1 every 1 wave, replace the mov eax,(value) and imul ebx/ecx  with mov edx,ebx/ecx and 5 nops


minigame spawn multipliers:
409833: column like you see em
409887 - the 4x multiplier code for Wall-nut Bowling & Wall-nut Bowling 2
other minigames are also around here
(409960 or 4098E6 - 4x multiplier. 409962 - 2x multiplier. 409964 - normal. lea ecx,[ecx+ecx*2] is 3x multiplier and higher lea's could also be used. These stack with the 409960/62 multipliers, so for example lea ecx,[ecx+ecx*2] followed by 409962 is 6x multiplier)

- The addresses in this section are floating-point constant addresses. They are REALLY not recommended to modify, since other things will be affected like seed packet icons. 
- To split them, you should do PvZ2-styled seed packets, like what lazypeaster do, then you can edit the image to be PvZ1-styled if you’re not gonna do PvZ2 style

(The addresses in tihs section are Imp Zombie and Gargantuar mechanic. Most of them are in Double Float. Still, it is REALLY not recommended to modify, since it will affect other stuffs such as seed packets.)
679498\\[floating point] basic value error (error is base value + [bunches of] random value so that it can make rng-ish data) of Imp Zombie's longitudinal velocity when is thrown by Gargantuar, or in other words, the error distance of Imp Zombie being thrown. Example, set it to 1000, and Imp will fall down very close to his "dad".
679380\\[double-floating point] basic value (the base this time) of Imp Zombie's longitudinal velocity when is thrown by Gargantuar, or in other words, the base distance of Imp Zombie being thrown. Example, set it to 1000, and Imp will fall down very close to his "dad".
679330\\[double-floating point] basic value of the Imp Zombie's height velocity when is thrown by Gargantuar. Set it to 1 for surprising jump :jerma_sus: :trollgod:
679300\\[double-floating point] basic value of the Imp Zombie's correction longitudinal velocity when is thrown by Gargantuar, but is REALLY, REALLY NOT recommended to modify, since it will glitch your pvz exe file to death.
6796D8\\[double-floating point] combination of 679380 and 679498 i believe
6798AC\\[double-floating point] same as 679498 eh? but any number you input will result in epic flying fail.
67A2B0\\[floating point] same as 679380 eh? but it's in float instead
67A2B8\\[double-floating point] the length of the Imp throwing, i believe. set it to 1000 for epic flying win.

   * Limbo Page - 2DF5D to 2DF5F: change 88 59 54 to 90 90 90
Since the design of the minigame windows has been changed (bigger), the team behind PvZ2PAK moved the layout to make it center and make the minigame name stay on the bottom-left corner.
These moved to the left 26 pixels.
   * (Survival) 2E00C: change 26 to 0C 
   *  (Minigame, Puzzle and Limbo) 2E035: change 26 to 0C
These moved to the right 26 pixels.
   *  (Longest Streaks, X Flags) 2EF3F: change 30 to 4C
(???) 
   * 2F03B to 2F051:

	________________


Now come to the minigame thumbnail, and the placement of it on a specific page. For every single minigame window, there will be the minigame ID and 4 following components, thumbnail, page, row, and col. For thumbnails, the ID will be used to determine which thumbnail should be used. For page, 00 is Survival, 01 is Minigames, 02 is Limbo, and 03 is Puzzle. If the mode is on the Survival page, the thumbnail will be taken from Survival_Thumbnails.png and vice versa.
These are some of the addresses which values had changed in PvZ2PAK.

Miscellaneous 


the plant that appears on the almanac index (default is sunflower):401C3E
Widescreen (permanently removed)
yuck
Widescreen has permanently been removed from the modding doc, nor will it be supported any longer by any of the editors going forward. This was due to it solely being used to grossly clickbait several mods and oftentimes being put into mods that DIDN’T support it.


An Anti-Widescreen Patch has also been developed by me (ayban!) in order to effectively stop the use and spread of clickbait. At the moment, it will be injected PRIVATELY, as if the code were to be released now, it is likely people in servers whom we will not name would reverse engineer it.


We’re sorry that this had to happen. The original intention of Widescreen was meant to be SOLELY for upping the QOL of PVZ 1, but after even Tod Semple (programmer of pvz1) himself said he didn’t like widescreen, and recent events with a certain mod, it was time to finally act on making this patch.  
This is directly from Tod Semple himself, the ORIGINAL PROGRAMMER OF Plants Vs. Zombies 1. So no, Widescreen will NEVER be supported ever again.
   




Finally, justice for that time that keif added widescreen even though not everyone agreed


If you have widescreen in your mod and no longer want it, you will have to start over; the reverse directions can be used to re-enable widescreen, which is a big no no. 




























                                                          However.




Times have changed and most of the issues stated are no longer present, therefore widescreen will be reinstated for the time being.
                                                           
                                                                     To add widescreen, you can:
You can use the base exe that EvilDogBot100 has made to have a very well made and fully functional widescreen for your mod. However, you must credit him in some way, shape or form as to respect his wishes. https://github.com/HenryJk/PvZWidescreen/releases/tag/v1.1.2 


OR you can use this manual version. Keep in mind it is not fully functional and may be buggy.

Anti-Widescreen Patch
A patch to prevent your mod being made into wide screen has been made. This will be distributed alongside pak encryption in MA for any major mod released in order to prevent the code from being reverse-engineered.
Custom Almanac Entries
CUSTOM ZOMBOTANY ALMANAC TUTORIAL (+Reverse Repeater) 
Open your PVZ mod files (should be Vanilla, not Zombatar. I'm stealing lazyPeaster's template lol) using HxD. 
C8 E9 66 is Basic Zombie almanac.
 C4 8B 66 is Repeater almanac. 
Peashooter Zombie : 29DD70, change C8 to C9 -> [OMBIE] 
Wall-nut Zombie : 29DD8C, change C8 to 09 -> [EL_ZOMBIE] 
Jalapeno Zombie : 29DDA8, change C8 to C6 -> [E] 
Gatling Pea Zombie : 29DDC4, change C8 to C5 -> [IE] 
Squash Zombie : 29DDE0, change C8 to C4 -> [BIE] 
Tall-nut Zombie : 29DDFC, change C8 to C3 -> [MBIE] 
Reverse Repeater : 29FA20, change C4 to C5 -> [EPEATER] 
Now, go to LawnStrings.txt, and add those keywords (the ones in the square brackets). Make your own new flavor.
PAK Encryption
Main.pak encryption (to prevent texture theft) has been found and will be distributed around in MA

0052722D-Seems to modify garg's throw animation speed in some form.
005271AF-Breaks gargs in strange ways, for example, upon releasing the imp, he can speed through the lawn, stay stuck and only get free upon being able to crush a plant, speed through but died on it own when halfway through the lawn, after releasing the imp turns black, still stay, and become invincible, Etc.though as the imp can stay stuck in the air or flat out die on its own before reaching the ground.

Scripts


Scripts are going to be the last section of this document.
They are often needed when changing something advanced about the game.


A Script is an injected set of lines of code typically used for a far more advanced thing, like a Gargantuar smashing plants in a 3 by 3 area or an entirely custom zombotany. While many scripts are public use, some of the more advanced ones are private.


How to use:
Scripts are .ct files that need to be opened in Cheat Engine, after opening it in cheat engine, hook your pvz .exe to cheat engine and proceed to press on the box, if an x appears on the box, the script should work, if not then you have done something wrong.



Those Scripts can be found in this doc here:  CLICK ME! E 
Ghidra
If you wanna take it to the next level and make your own scripts, the Ghidra decompiler can help finding and identifying interesting code (interoperability purposes only) . 
Install Ghidra here.

And that is it. for now.
